# Advent of Code
> These are NOT the best solution (although I try to achieve that with every task), some of them may even be the worst.

Collection of my solutions for advent of code for the years and languages.
For now three language is used:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Lua

If there is no folder for the language, it means that I did not uploaded it yet.

To run the python codes, create a virtualenv in the year folder
```sh
python -m venv <YEAR>/.venv
```

Activate the virtualenv:
```sh
source <YEAR>/.venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the requirements:
```sh
pip install -r <YEAR>/requirements.txt
```

If you do not wish to use the virtualenv anymore just run:
```sh
deactivate
```
